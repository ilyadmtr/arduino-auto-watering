# Arduino Smart Watering System

This project is the firmware and software for a smart plant watering system based on Arduino Nano, Spring Boot backend, and Angular frontend.

## Hardware
- Arduino Nano
- YL-69 soil moisture sensor (tested and working)
- 5V water pump with relay
- Power supply: 4Ã—AAA batteries
- ESP-01S Wi-Fi module (planned)

## Firmware
A test project for the YL-69 soil moisture sensor is available in:
[moisture_sensor](moisture_sensor/moisture_sensor_test.ino)
A reset project for resetting the Arduino is available in:
[reset](reset/reset.ino)
